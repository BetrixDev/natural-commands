## OpenRouter Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up OpenRouter for use with Natural Commands.

## What is OpenRouter?

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) is a unified API that provides access to various AI models from different providers. It allows you to use models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and other providers through a single API.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create an Account

1. Visit [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Get Started"
3. Create an account using your email or GitHub

### 2. Get Your API Key

1. After signing in, navigate to the [API Keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) section
2. Click "Create Key"
3. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Natural Commands")
4. Copy the generated API key

### 3. Configure Natural Commands

1. Open your server's `plugins/NaturalCommands/config.yml` file
2. Paste your API key into the `open_router_token` field:

```yaml
open_router_token: "your-api-key-here"
```

## Available Models

OpenRouter provides access to various AI models. Here are some recommended models for Natural Commands. View them [here](https://openrouter.ai/models). To select a model, click on the clipboard icon to copy the model's id.

## Model Selection
