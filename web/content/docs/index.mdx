## Prerequisites

- A Minecraft server running Paper (or compatible fork)
- An OpenRouter API key
- Java 17 or higher

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of Natural Commands from the releases page
2. Place the plugin JAR file in your server's `plugins` directory
3. Start or restart your server

## Configuration

The plugin requires configuration of your OpenRouter API key and model selection. Here's how to set it up:

1. Navigate to your server's `plugins/NaturalCommands` directory
2. Open the `config.yml` file
3. Configure the following settings:

```yaml
# Your OpenRouter API key
open_router_token: "your-api-key-here"

# The AI model to use (e.g., "google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview")
open_router_model: "your-preferred-model"
```

For detailed instructions on setting up OpenRouter, see our [OpenRouter Setup Guide](/docs/openrouter).

### Available Models

Natural Commands works with various models available through OpenRouter. Some recommended models include:

- `google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview`
- `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
- `anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet`

## Usage

Once configured, you can use the plugin in-game with the following command:

```
/prompt <your natural language request>
```

For example:

- `/prompt give me a diamond sword`
- `/prompt teleport me to spawn`
- `/prompt summon a zombie with full diamond armor`

The plugin will generate the appropriate Minecraft command based on your request.

For more detailed information about available commands, see our [Commands Guide](/docs/commands).
