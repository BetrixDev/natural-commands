# Prompt Command

The `/prompt` command allows you to generate Minecraft commands using natural language. This powerful feature uses AI to understand your intent and convert it into valid Minecraft commands.

## Usage

```
/prompt <your prompt>
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the prompt command:

### Basic Commands

- `/prompt give me a diamond sword`
- `/prompt teleport me to spawn`
- `/prompt set the time to day`

### Complex Commands

- `/prompt summon a zombie with full diamond armor and a sharpness 5 diamond sword`
- `/prompt create a 5x5x5 cube of diamond blocks at my position`
- `/prompt give me a stack of golden apples with the name "Healing Fruit"`

### Entity Manipulation

- `/prompt make all zombies invisible`
- `/prompt give all players 10 levels`

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be Specific**: The more details you provide, the better the command will be

   - Good: `/prompt give me a diamond sword with sharpness 5 and unbreaking 3`
   - Less Good: `/prompt give me a sword`

2. **Use Natural Language**: Write your request as you would say it

   - Good: `/prompt make it rain for 5 minutes`
   - Less Good: `/prompt /weather rain 300`

3. **Break Down Complex Requests**: For very complex commands, try breaking them into steps
   - Instead of: `/prompt create a castle with towers and a moat`
   - Try: `/prompt create a 20x20 stone platform` then `/prompt build 4 stone towers at the corners`

## Limitations

- The command can only generate one command at a time
- Some very complex requests might not be possible with a single command
- The AI might not always understand highly technical or game-specific terminology
- Commands are limited to what's possible in the current Minecraft version

## Troubleshooting

If the generated command doesn't work as expected:

1. Try rephrasing your request to be more specific
2. Break down complex requests into simpler steps
3. Check if the command is valid for your Minecraft version
4. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the command
